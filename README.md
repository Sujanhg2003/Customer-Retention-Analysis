# Customer Retention Analysis

## Problem Statement
### The telecom industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers, as acquiring them is costly and highly competitive. The Retention Managerâ€™s goal is to prevent customer churn by identifying at-risk customers before they terminate their contracts. Currently, the company approaches retention reactively, contacting customers only after they have left, which has proven ineffective. With the wealth of customer data available, the telecom aims to adopt a proactive strategy that leverages predictive analytics to forecast churn and enables timely intervention. However, past customer analysis using traditional methods like Excel has not yielded actionable insights, leading to dead ends in the analysis process.
### 
### To address these issues, the telecom company seeks to develop a comprehensive dashboard that clearly visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) around customer churn. The goal is to create an easily understandable and interactive dashboard for management, highlighting at-risk customers based on factors such as usage patterns, contract duration, billing information, and customer interactions. This approach will not only improve customer retention efforts but also streamline the decision-making process by offering clear insights into customer behavior and churn risk.
